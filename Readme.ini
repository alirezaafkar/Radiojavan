This script is written in Python3 by Nimasajedi[at]gmail.com on 20th May 2017 to exctract direct download links for musics/video clips 
(3 different video quality)/podcasts and albums on Radiojavan.com. Moreover, it generates file size and depicts cover photos alongside 
showing artist/art name for each supported RJ link. This is the same copy running on http://mynext.pro/RJ as of today. You may use it for free. To do so, you have to 
modify it on following lines: 
1,7,11,34,37,47,49,194,205,214,239,266,271.

Lines 3,5 are python packages which have to be installed in advance.
